## WEATHER APP

This SPA was made using React, Javascript and CSS for the SoyHenry's Bootcamp. It consumes information from an api and allows you to search for the weather forecast by city.

If you want to try it, download the repository and run the commands "npm install" and then "npm start".

CHECK IT OUT!
